# PROJECT_STATE.md — The World We Live In

> Living status document. Updated at every checkpoint. Read this first when resuming.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-18 (Checkpoint C3 — Phase 3 complete & verified)
**Current phase:** Phase 3 done ✅ → next: Phase 4 (player movement + survival resource loop)
**Overall status:** 🟢 Healthy. No drift. Build/test/lint green; runtime-verified in a browser preview.

---

## What this project is
Android-first (iOS later) mobile game: a low-poly / voxel-style planetary civilization
survival simulator. Crash-land → survive → gather/hunt/farm/build → recruit NPC survivors →
grow a settlement → advance through civilization eras → emergent social systems
(families, factions, beliefs, governance, laws, economy) → scale to planet/orbit/galaxy.
Offline-first, friend-based multiplayer later, **AdMob ad revenue built in**.

## Stack (locked — see TECH_DECISIONS.md)
TypeScript (strict) · React 18 · Three.js (react-three-fiber) · Zustand · Vite ·
Vitest/ESLint/Prettier · Capacitor (Android first) · AdMob via `@capacitor-community/admob`.
Pure-TS **deterministic sim core** independent of React/DOM/renderer.

## How to run
```
npm install        # once
npm run dev        # Vite dev server (web) — main loop runs the sim
npm run build      # type-check + production build
npm run test       # Vitest unit tests (sim core)
npm run lint       # ESLint
```
Android export is documented for Phase 16 (requires JDK 17 — NOT yet installed on this machine).

## What works right now
- `npm run dev` boots a playable web prototype rendered in **real 3D (react-three-fiber)**
  over a **procedurally generated low-poly planet**: seeded heightmap terrain with biomes
  (water/sand/grass/forest/rock/snow), a water plane at sea level, faceted flat-shaded look,
  and a working **day/night lighting cycle**.
- **Procedural generation lives in the sim core** (`src/sim/planet`): deterministic value
  noise + fBm → heightmap + biomes; resource nodes are scattered onto land and chosen by
  biome, seated on the surface via bilinear height sampling. Same seed → identical planet.
- **Mobile camera/input:** touch-friendly camera rig (drag-pan + pinch-zoom via drei
  MapControls); tap a resource node to gather.
- HUD overlay (clock, resource tallies, ad button) adapts to portrait/landscape.
- **Monetization** verified at runtime earlier: "Watch ad" → MockAdService → +10 wood.
- `npm run test` (34 passing), `npm run build` (tsc + vite; ~992 KB JS / 276 KB gz — three.js
  is heavy, code-splitting deferred to Phase 15), `npm run lint` (clean) — all green.

## Built so far
| Phase | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 0 Inspect + choose stack | ✅ done | Empty workspace, Node 20.11.1, git 2.43, no Godot/Java. Stack = TS/React/Capacitor/AdMob. |
| 1 Runnable skeleton | ✅ done | Vite+React+TS tooling; pure sim core (RNG/clock/World/intents); GameLoop; Zustand bridge; AdService abstraction; HUD. Verified green. |
| 2 Mobile input/camera/orientation | ✅ done | react-three-fiber 3D scene; pure day/night lighting model; drei MapControls camera (pan/pinch); tap-to-gather; responsive HUD. Build/test/lint green + runtime-verified. |
| 3 Procedural planet prototype | ✅ done | Seeded value-noise/fBm heightmap + biomes (sim core); faceted low-poly terrain mesh + water; biome-based node placement on the surface. Build/test/lint green + runtime-verified. |
| 4 Player movement + survival loop | ⬜ next | See ROADMAP.md |
| 5–16 | ⬜ not started | See ROADMAP.md |

## What is stubbed (and honestly NOT finished)
- AdService: real AdMob impl deferred; **MockAdService** used in dev/web.
- Save service: interface only so far; real persistence is Phase 12.
- Render: placeholder until react-three-fiber lands (Phase 2/3).
- Multiplayer: interfaces only, never implemented (offline-first), Phase 14.

## What failed / blocked
- None yet. (Android build blocked until JDK 17 installed — not needed before Phase 16.)

## Next exact task
Phase 4 — player movement + survival resource loop: add a movable player (tap-to-move toward a
point / target on the terrain, with terrain-follow height), and survival needs
(hunger/thirst/energy) as a per-tick system in the sim core that decays over time and is
relieved by consuming gathered food/water. Surface needs in the HUD. Add a fail/low-state.
Keep needs logic pure + tested in the sim core.

Known tunables to revisit: in-world day length is ~60s real per day (TICKS_PER_HOUR=50 @20Hz) —
likely lengthen for real survival pacing in Phase 4. Terrain is a single mesh; true chunking/LOD
comes with the planet-scale zoom in Phase 13. Bundle code-splitting deferred to Phase 15.

## Current architecture assumptions
- Sim core is deterministic and renderer-agnostic; UI never mutates world directly — it
  dispatches *intents*. Data flows one way: Input → Intent → Sim → State snapshot → UI/Render.
- All monetization goes through `AdService`; gameplay never calls the AdMob SDK directly.
- Save data is versioned JSON with explicit migrations.

## Git / remote
- Local repo: branch `main`. Identity set locally to jojos / co.nosiah@gmail.com
  (change with `git config user.name/user.email` if desired).
- Remote: ✅ **configured & pushed.** `origin` =
  https://github.com/BDookie02/The-Word-We-Live-In.git (note: repo name reads "Word" not
  "World" — rename on GitHub if unintended, then `git remote set-url origin <new>`).
- Push at each checkpoint with `git push`.
